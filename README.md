# Why we wrote this Handbook

Deep learning is a promising approach for classifying patterns in data. In contrast to conventional single hidden layer neural networks the many hidden layers in deep learning makes that the algorithm is able to learn more complex and more abstract signal patterns (features). 




## Key objectives are: 

* Map out latest trends in deep learning for time series based on scanning the literature and searching for online tools
* Identify test case/working example
* Develop a tool to classify patterns in time series using deep learning that is: 

## Key requirements: 

o Easily accessible for scientists with no expertise in deep learning or HPC 
o Gives the scientist the opportunity to embed their scientific models, such that deep learning is more than a black box to them. For example, the scientific model is the starting point for the training process 
o Demonstrate that our tools are more accurate and/or more feasible than conventional approaches.
