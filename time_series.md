# Time series

Most attention in the literature and in the news has gone to deep learning in image processing, e.g. video analyses, while relatively little attention is given to the potential of deep learning for time series analyses. 

Building a deep learning algorithm requires specific expertise with neural networks and high-performance computing, which prohibit uptake by domain scientists.  Further, domain scientists may be skeptical about using deep learning because of its black box nature. The aim of this project is to develop a generic tool for deep learning that is useful for time series classification in science.


## Trends in literature: 

## User examples 

## Summary of requirements 

o Easily accessible for scientists with no expertise in deep learning or HPC 
o Gives the scientist the opportunity to embed their scientific models, such that deep learning is more than a black box to them. For example, the scientific model is the starting point for the training process 
o Demonstrate that our tools are more accurate and/or more feasible than conventional approaches.
