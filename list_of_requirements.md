# List of requirements

* Easily accessible for scientists with no expertise in deep learning or high performance computing
* Gives the scientist the opportunity to embed their scientific models, such that deep learning is more than a black box to them. For example, the scientific model is the starting point for the training process
* Demonstrate that our tools are more accurate and/or more feasible than conventional approaches. 
* Utilize state of the art deep learning techniques
* Flexible to handle range of time series types/dimensions
* Visualization tool:
  * Label and classification check relative to raw data
  * Visualise new DL features relative to raw data
* Ability to output new DL features
* Accessible to domain scientists
* Publication in domain science journal, with:
  * Demonstration of validity in representative dataset and based on multiple performance metrics
  * Clear guidance on expected limitations of the classifier
  * Guidance on how to link ‘new’ deep learning features to biological/physical phenomena and theory
* Early stage interaction with domain scientists to ensure long term uptake
